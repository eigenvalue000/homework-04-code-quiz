# Homework 04 : Code Quiz

## Description
The motivation of this project was to create a quiz application that is multiple choice,
has a timer, logs the user's score, and quits when the timer runs out or the user finishes 
the quiz.

This project was built to gain experience and practice using
JavaScript, specifically creating and appending elements, setting timers, and
using local storage.

This project implements a timer, generates questions as children
objects of the body, references array objects, and uses buttons
and an eventListener.
